    "Implement the 'Organic & Earthy' theme immediately in tailwind.config.js.",

  "UNIVERSAL_GUIDELINES_FOR_MAIN_AGENT": [
    "Dark colors look good when used independently without gradients. DO NOT use dark colors as gradients.",
    "Don't make generic centered layouts, simplistic gradients, and uniform styling.",
    "Create depth through layered design elements with z-index hierarchy.",
    "Use glass-morphism effects with backdrop filters (12-24px blur).",
    "You MUST NOT apply universal transition. Eg: transition: all. This results in breaking transforms.",
    "You MUST NOT center align the app container.",
    "Always use modern button styles like pill-shaped, or sharp button with interaction animations.",
    "NEVER use AI assistant Emoji characters.",
    "Every interaction needs micro-animations.",
    "Use 2-3x more spacing than feels comfortable.",
    "Subtle grain textures, noise overlays, custom cursors, selection states, and loading animations: separates good from extraordinary.",
    "Main agent relies on these image URLs. Missing categories = main agent will use placeholder text which is FORBIDDEN.",
    "Prioritize using pre-existing components from src/components/ui when applicable.",
    "Components MUST use named exports.",
    "Pages MUST use default exports.",
    "Use sonner for toasts."
